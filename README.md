# Arabic Medical Text Classification  
**AbjadNLP Shared Task @ EACL 2026**

This repository contains the code for the **Arabic Medical Text Classification** shared task organized as part of the **Abjad NLP Workshop at EACL 2026**.

The dataset consists of Arabic **question–answer pairs** in the healthcare domain. Each sample includes:
- `text`: an Arabic medical question–answer pair  
- `category`: the medical category (translated into English for clarity)  
- `label`: the integer class label to be predicted  

The task involves classifying each text into one of **82 medical categories**. The dataset is **highly imbalanced**, making it a challenging and realistic classification problem.

This work aims to advance **Arabic NLP for healthcare**, an important yet underexplored domain in Abjad-script languages.
